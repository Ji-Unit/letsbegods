## Weekly Study Group

> Meetings TBD

---

## Structure

> Weekly algorithms will be based topics ie. arrays, trees, ...etc. Decision to extend the length of a topic will fall onto the group but will generally last about 2 weeks.

* Inital goal is to get as many "Easy" problems out the way first to establish a foundation
* When team agrees to move onto "Mediums", we will do so.

---

## Selecting Problems

> Each week a member of the team will be the "Algo Captain". This member is responsible for selecting the algorithms the team will work on the following week. Other members of the team can suggest or add to the list of problems, but the weekly "Algo Captain" will be held responsible for ensuring at least 10 algos are selected.

* Here's the order in which we will go through:
  * Nick
  * Patrick
  * Ji
  * Jason
  * Ron

## Rules

Just let someone know if you won't be able to complete your task.

Since we'll all be contributing to this, would probably be a good idea to fork the main repo, do your work there, then have someone merge your PR. That way we call all get shiny green squares :)

Since this could be shared with potential future employers let's keep commit messages PG.
