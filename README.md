## Weekly Study Group
> Meetings @ 7:30 Tuesdays and Thursdays

----
## Structure
> Initial structure will be to have 2 algos done before meeting day. We'll start out with a light load and add on more if we feel the need. Structure goes as follows:

* 1 Codefights problem
* 1 Leetcode problem
    * 1 Easy on Tuesdays
    * 1 Medium on Thursdays

> Most likely we are going to have some extra time, especially in the beginning. We can probably discuss then how we'll use our time. One good idea would be to select a more complex problem and practice some TDD as a group.

----
## Folder Structure
Folder structure will go as follows:

* Root
    * Week_1
        * Tuesday
           * Problem_Name
               * ji.js
               * nahee.js
               * nick.js
               * rat-face-patrick.js

## Rules
Just let someone know if you won't be able to complete your task.

Since we'll all be contributing to this, would probably be a good idea to fork the main repo, do your work there, then have someone merge your PR. That way we call all get shiny green squares :)

Since this could be shared with potential future employers let's keep commit messages PG.
