## Rules

Just let someone know if you won't be able to complete your task.

Since we'll all be contributing to this, would probably be a good idea to fork the main repo, do your work there, then have someone merge your PR. That way we call all get shiny green squares :)

Since this could be shared with potential future employers let's keep commit messages PG.
